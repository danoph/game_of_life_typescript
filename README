Assumptions:
- Node >7 installed
- karma-cli installed (npm i -g karma-cli)
- You aren't using windows

Setup:
- after cloning repo, run `npm install`
- to start karma, run `karma start`

Saving files will automatically trigger the karma test runner to run the tests.

General Notes:
- think of describe() as "when", such as:
  "when password does not contain an uppercase character" ->

  describe('password does not contain an uppercase character...'

- think of it() as "then", such as:
  "then the isValid method should return false"

  it('returns false...'

- think of beforeEach() as "given", such as:
  "given my password is 'Password123!'"

  beforeEach(() => {
    password = 'Password123!'
  });
